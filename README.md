Anime has become a globally recognized form of entertainment with millions of fans around the world. MyAnimeList (MAL) is one of the most popular platforms that provides detailed information about anime, including ratings, number of episodes, release type, and user popularity.

In this project, I performed web scraping on the Top 250 Anime page on MyAnimeList to extract key information that can be used for further data analysis.

## Features
- **Extracts data** from multiple web pages, supporting pagination.
- **Data cleaning**: Handles missing values, duplicates, and formatting issues to ensure the data is ready for analysis.
- **Data visualization**: Creates visualizations such as graphs and charts to help analyze the scraped data.
- Data is saved in structured formats like **CSV**, **JSON**, or directly to a **database**.

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.12**
- **BeautifulSoup** for parsing HTML
- **Requests** for HTTP requests
- **pandas** for data manipulation and analysis.
- **duckdb** for in-process SQL OLAP database management system.
- **matplotlib** for data visualization
- **seaborn** for data visualization
